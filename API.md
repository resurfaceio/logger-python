## Creating Loggers

To get started, first you'll need to create a `HttpLogger` instance. Here there are options to specify a URL (for where JSON 
messages will be sent) and/or a specific set of <a href="https://resurface.io/rules.html">logging rules</a> (for what privacy 
protections to apply). Default values will be used for either of these if specific values are not provided.

```python
from usagelogger import HttpLogger

# with default url and rules
logger = HttpLogger()

# with specific url and default rules
logger = HttpLogger(url='https://...')

# with specific url and rules
logger = HttpLogger(url='https://...', rules='include strict')

# with specific url and rules from local file
logger = HttpLogger(url='https://...', rules='file://./rules.txt')
```

## Logging HTTP Calls

Now that you have a logger instance, let's do some logging. Here you can pass standard request/response objects, as well
as response body and request body content when these are available. 

```python
from usagelogger import HttpMessage

# with standard objects
HttpMessage.send(logger, request, response)

# with response body
HttpMessage.send(logger, request, response, response_body='my-response-body')

# log with response and request body
HttpMessage.send(logger, request, response, response_body='my-response-body', request_body='my-request-body')
```

If standard request and response objects aren't available in your case, create mock implementations to pass instead.

```python
from usagelogger import HttpRequestImpl, HttpResponseImpl

# define request to log
request = HttpRequestImpl()
request.body = 'some json'
request.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
request.method = 'POST'
request.params['B'] = '234'  # POST param
request.url = 'http://resurface.io'

# define response to log
response = HttpResponseImpl()
response.body = 'some html'
response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/html; charset=utf-8'
response.status = 200

# log objects defined above
HttpMessage.send(logger, request, response)
```

## Setting Default Rules

If no <a href="https://resurface.io/rules.html">rules</a> are provided when creating a logger, the default value of 
`include strict` will be applied. A different default value can be specified as shown below.

```python
HttpRules.set_default_rules('include debug')
```

When specifying multiple default rules, put each on a separate line. This is most easily done with a multi-line string.

```python
HttpRules.set_default_rules("""
    include debug
    sample 10
""")
```

## Setting Default URL

If your application creates more than one logger, or requires different URLs for different environments (development vs
testing vs production), then set the `USAGE_LOGGERS_URL` environment variable as shown below. This value will be applied if no
other URL is specified when creating a logger.

```bash
# from command line
export USAGE_LOGGERS_URL="https://..."

# for Heroku cli
heroku config:set USAGE_LOGGERS_URL=https://...
```

## Enabling and Disabling Loggers

Individual loggers can be controlled through their `enable` and `disable` methods. When disabled, loggers will
not send any logging data, and the result returned by the `log` method will always be true (success).

All loggers for an application can be enabled or disabled at once with the `UsageLoggers` class. This even controls
loggers that have not yet been created by the application.

```python
from usagelogger import UsageLoggers

UsageLoggers.disable()    # disable all loggers
UsageLoggers.enable()     # enable all loggers
```

All loggers can be permanently disabled with the `USAGE_LOGGERS_DISABLE` environment variable. When set to true,
loggers will never become enabled, even if `UsageLoggers.enable()` is called by the application. This is primarily 
done by automated tests to disable all logging even if other control logic exists. 

```bash
# from command line
export USAGE_LOGGERS_DISABLE="true"

# for Heroku app
heroku config:set USAGE_LOGGERS_DISABLE=true
```
